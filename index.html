        <p>Hi, my name is Victoire and I am a front-en web developer.</p>
        <p>I decided to do a career change the last year, and It’s been 6 months that I learn coding with online courses
            as a self-taught. </p>
        <p>I began to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery as a self-taught without any formal education in computer
            science, only via the websites like codecademy, freecodecamp, openclassroom, w3schools… </p>
        <p>I completed this learning process by the Coding Boot Camp at UC Berkeley extension. It was a great experience where I learn everything. </p>
