                <p>My name is Victoire and I am a full-stack developer.</p>
                <p>I decided to do a career change the last year, and for 6 months I learned coding with online
                    courses
                    as a self-taught. </p>
                <p>I began to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery without any formal education in
                    computer
                    science, only via the websites like codecademy, freecodecamp, openclassroom, w3schools… </p>
                <p>I completed this learning process by the Coding Boot Camp at UC Berkeley extension. It was a really
                    great
                    experience
                    where I learned a lot. </p>
                <p>During this program, I attended informative lectures and took part in a variety of individual and
                    team
                    exercises, working independently and in groups, in the classroom and at home.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    To build my projects, I had to combine my knowledges of frond-end and back-end technologies. You
                    will find my portfolio which recounts what I could accomplish during my
                    apprenticeship.</p>
